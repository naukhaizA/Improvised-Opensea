**Improvised OpenSea **
Description:
Opensea is a market place that allows a user to mint an NFT and make it public while holding the digital signature of that particular asset. It also provides the user with the facility to sell that asset either at a fixed price or at an auction where other users bid, and the highest bid gets the sale
Motive:
The motive of this project would be to add a lazy minting feature. Lazy minting isÂ when an NFT is available off-chain and only gets minted once a sale takes place. This means that the artist does not have to pay any upfront gas fees to mint their NFTs, essentially paying the fees only once the token is purchased.
